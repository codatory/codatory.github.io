Ok, we laid down a base operating system and now we need to get Kubernetes running on top.
I selected the K0S distribution, for a balance of being a mostly standard Kubernetes stack
and having some really easy tooling for deploying and maintaining the cluster.

Because of the number of nodes (more than 1), I installed with [k0sctl](https://docs.k0sproject.io/v1.25.4+k0s.0/k0sctl-install/). My [k0sctl.yml](https://gist.github.com/codatory/57f001f9937b59aec7ee3323166ab810) file simply lists the servers and their roles, and becase Ansible has already been configured for these hosts all of my SSH keys and passwordless sudo are ready.

With k0sctl downloaded into my path and the config file ready, I simply ran `k0sctl apply --config k0sctl.yml` and in a few minutes I had a Kubernetes cluster up and running. To make standard Kubernetes tools work reliably I also issued a `mkdir ~/.kube; k0sctl kubeconfig > ~/.kube/config`. Now I can use kubectl, helm and lens to manage my cluster.

Great, so now we have a functional cluster, but it's missing a lot of features. Next up we'll configure [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) so we can connect services to virtual IP's and deploy an [Ingress](https://traefik.io/traefik/) on top of that.
